Build a production-level Sentiment Analysis Tool that can analyze text, documents, social media content, and uploaded files (TXT, CSV, PDF) for sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral, and optionally Mixed, Strong Positive, Strong Negative). The tool should include real-time analysis, data visualization, report generation, and user management for enterprise use.

Key Features & Requirements
1. Core Sentiment Analysis
Real-time text input analysis with instant results as the user types.

Support for multiple languages (auto-detect language and translate if needed before analysis).

Accept multiple data sources:

Manual text entry

File uploads (TXT, CSV, PDF)

URL fetch (scrape webpage text)

API integration for third-party apps (e.g., social media feeds, chatbots)

Advanced sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed, Strong Positive, Strong Negative.

Confidence score for each prediction.

Keyword & entity extraction to show context (who/what is being discussed).

Emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.) using NLP models.

Custom training option where users can upload their own labeled dataset.

2. Visualization & Insights
Interactive charts and graphs showing sentiment distribution (Pie chart, Bar chart, Line trend over time).

Word clouds for frequently used positive/negative words.

Time-based analysis to see sentiment changes.

Comparative analysis between different datasets.

3. User Management & Roles
Authentication (Email/Password, Google, Microsoft login).

Role-based access:

Admin: Manage users, datasets, and model configurations.

Analyst: Upload data, view reports, export results.

Viewer: Read-only access to reports.

4. Data Export & Reporting
Export results in CSV, PDF, and Excel formats.

Generate automated reports with visualizations.

Schedule periodic email reports.

5. Integrations
REST API for external apps.

Slack, Microsoft Teams, and WhatsApp notifications for sentiment alerts.

Social media integration (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit).

6. Performance & Scalability
Cloud-ready (Dockerized, deployable to AWS/GCP/Azure).

Handle large datasets with background processing (queue-based architecture).

Caching for repeated analysis.

7. Security
JWT-based authentication.

HTTPS encryption.

Role-based permissions.

Data anonymization for privacy.

UI/UX Requirements
1. Modern & Attractive Design
Glassmorphism / Neumorphism inspired design or clean Material UI 2.0 look.

Light/Dark mode toggle.

Smooth animations (Framer Motion or GSAP).

Minimalistic, responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

2. Dashboard
Summary cards showing:

Total texts analyzed

Positive / Negative / Neutral counts

Average sentiment score

Quick action buttons:

"Analyze Text"

"Upload File"

"Connect API"

3. Data Visualization
Interactive charts (click to drill down into specific sentiment categories).

Hover tooltips with detailed stats.

Real-time sentiment meter gauge.

4. User Experience
Auto-save for typed text in case of refresh.

Drag-and-drop file upload.

Inline loading animations.

Error states with friendly messages.

Onboarding wizard for new users.

Technical Stack Recommendations
Frontend: React.js (Next.js or Vite), Tailwind CSS + Material UI, Framer Motion animations.

Backend: Node.js (Express.js) or Python (FastAPI/Flask).

AI/NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, or TensorFlow for sentiment & emotion analysis.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Auth: Firebase Auth / Auth0 / Custom JWT.

Deployment: Docker, CI/CD pipeline.

Deliverables:

Fully functional web app.

Clean, reusable code with comments.

Unit & integration tests.

Deployment-ready Docker image.

Documentation for API & UI usage.

Example datasets for demo.
